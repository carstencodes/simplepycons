# simplepycons

Python wrappers for [simple-icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons)
inspired by the [wonderful work of sachinraja](https://github.com/sachinraja/simple-icons-py).

As latter project seems to be no longer maintained, this project starts as being compatible to
simple-icons 13.x

## Usage

The simplepycons namespace contains the following types:

* Icon: The basic icon class, from which all Icons are inherited. It is abstract and hence cannot be inherited. 
* all_icons: A collection of all icons found.
* IconFactory: A simple wrapper providing a callable interface and a prototype.

as well as a class for each icon provided.

So, you can run:

```python
from simplepycons import all_icons, PythonIcon

icon1 = PythonIcon()
icon2 = all_icons.get_python_icon()
icon3 = all_icons["python"]
```

All calls should provide a new `Icon` instance of the python icon.

For all simple-icons, a get icon method is provided using the name of the icon.

An instance of `Icon` offers the following properties:

* name (str): The name of the icon, i.e. the name of the simple-icon id.
* original_file_name (str): The name of the file it was created from.
* title (str): The name of the brand
* primary_color (str): The primary color of the brand.
* raw_svg (str): The RAW SVG graphics as string.
* guidelines_url (str | None): The url to the usage guidelines (optional).
* license (tuple[str | None, str | None]): The license as a tuple. The first element is the SPDX identifier, the second element is the URL to the license document (optional).
* source (str): The source URL of the icon.
* aliases (Iterable[str]): A list of aliases used as alternative titles

An instance of `Icon` offers the following methods:

* svg_tree() (xml.ElementTree.Element): The SVG as XML Element
* customize_svg(**svg_attr: str) (xml.ElementTree.Element): The SVG with custom attributes on the root node.
* customize_svg_as_bytes(**svg_attr: str) (bytes): The SVG with custom attributes on the root node, converted to a bytes object.
* customize_svg_as_str(**svg_attr: str) (str): The SVG with custom attributes on the root node, converted to string.
* customize_svg_as_data_url_(**svg_attr: str) (str): The SVG with custom attributes on the root node, converted to a base64 encoded data url.

The `svg_attr` keyword arguments can be used to add any arbitrary svg attribute to the SVG root node. If `fill` is not used, the `primary_color` is used.
